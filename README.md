### Comprehensive API Testing with Postman

- **GET Requests:**
  - Retrieve data from the server to ensure the endpoints return the correct information as per the specified parameters.

- **POST Requests:**
  - Submit data to the server, primarily used to create new resources, verifying the API's ability to correctly process and store new entries.

- **PUT Requests:**
  - Update existing resources entirely by replacing them with the new data provided, checking the API’s functionality in handling complete data updates.

- **PATCH Requests:**
  - Apply partial modifications to existing resources, ensuring the API can handle updates to specific fields within a resource without affecting the entire data set.

- **DELETE Requests:**
  - Remove resources from the server, testing the API’s ability to delete specified records accurately and confirming that it responds appropriately to deletion requests.

During these tests, responses are meticulously verified against expected outcomes to ensure the APIs function correctly, handle errors gracefully, and meet the required performance standards.
