<p>
  I am engaged in comprehensive API testing for both a Book API and a Ticket System API using Postman. My testing process encompasses the following HTTP methods:

<b>GET Requests:</b>

Retrieve data from the server to ensure the endpoints are returning the correct information as per the specified parameters.
<b>POST Requests:</b>

Submit data to the server, primarily used to create new resources. This verifies the API's ability to correctly process and store new entries.
<b>PUT Requests:</b>

Update existing resources entirely by replacing them with the new data provided. This checks the API’s functionality in handling complete data updates.
<b>PATCH Requests:</b>

Apply partial modifications to existing resources. This ensures the API can handle updates to specific fields within a resource without affecting the entire data set.
<b>DELETE Requests:</b>

Remove resources from the server. This tests the API’s ability to delete specified records accurately and confirms that it responds appropriately to deletion requests.
In conducting these tests, I meticulously verify the responses against expected outcomes, ensuring the APIs function correctly, handle errors gracefully, and meet the required performance standards.
